In PART 1's code, I have made two #if statements, first one is to run the program normally, where as the second #if is to run all of the 
chopstick variants 5 times (within each run the philosophers will eat three times).
if there are no arguments, the default chopsticks will be 8.

In PART 2's code, instead of a parameter, it takes in a argument instead, so please enter the number of thread desired after the ./ call.
So for example if 4 thread is wanted, then in the terminal enter: ./Assignment3Part2 4
If no parameter is entered for part 2, then a default of 2 threads will be executed. 
The range of values in this part will be from 1 to 100,000,000

To make the executables, simply run: "make -f Makefile.mk"   in the terminal.
    

ALL OF THE CODE SHOWN IS FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSE AND IS USED TO ONLY SHOWCASE MULTI-THREADING APPLICATIONS
IN ORDER TO RUN THE PROGRAM, LINUX OS ENVIRONMENT (POSIX) IS REQUIRED
